# Titanic-dataset
Using the titanic data to predict the survival of the passengers.
WorkFlow of the project (work still in progress)

1. **Loading Libraries**
a. Numpy
b. Pandas
c. Matplotlib and seaborn
d. sklearn for accuracy and algorithms with data-preprocessing purposes

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
-Exploring the data like how many rows and columns shape of training and testing data, finding the missing values in the dataset

-Dummy encoding done on the categorical data.

-For Certain algorithms to work we must normalize the data so I have normalized using StandardScaler method

3. **Training and Testing of Data**
importing KNN, GaussianNB, DecisionTree etc.. libraries, train_test_split library for model selection and to avoid overfitting of the model used.

**Optional- Data Visualization**
tried making notebook more interactive

Work in Progress!! got 0.77 accuracy so far, will be improving it.


To get a better understanding of the workflow of a Machine Learning project, have a read:

1. sklearn documentation is also recommended.
